## Why I built this site
I didn‚Äôt want a generic portfolio page.  
Most student or junior websites look the same: name, CV, GitHub links, maybe a couple of projects.  
I wanted something different ‚Äî a place where I could **share projects, notes, and let people talk directly with an AI version of me**.

---

## Tech stack
I went with **Next.js + Tailwind** for the frontend.  
For data, I use **Supabase** as both the database and the vector store (pgvector) to power my RAG pipeline.  
The AI chat runs on **OpenAI models** (tested with GPT-4.1-mini for speed), and embeddings are updated automatically when I add new content (projects, notes, or CV data).

---

## Minimalist design
I kept the design clean:
- No clutter, no animations for the sake of animations.
- One landing page with just my name, what I do, links to projects, notes, socials ‚Äî and the **chat**.
- I wanted visitors to feel they can *immediately interact*, not just scroll.

---

## The AI chat
This is the part I‚Äôm most proud of.  
The chat isn‚Äôt just a toy ‚Äî it‚Äôs a personalized assistant trained on:
- My **CV data** (experience, skills, roadmap, etc.)
- My **projects** (from `projects.json`)
- My **notes/blog posts** (chunked by headings for precision)

The goal was to make it feel like you‚Äôre talking to me, but **grounded strictly in my own data**.  
No hallucinated nonsense, no fake projects.  

If the context is missing, the bot falls back with:  
*‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt shared that yet, but you can reach me directly at vito.senic@gmail.com.‚Äù*

## Lessons learned
- Keeping data **structured in JSON** (CV, projects) makes embedding + RAG pipelines much cleaner.
- **Chunking matters.** Each project, each section of my CV, and each blog heading is its own chunk for better retrieval.
- Prompt engineering is 50% of the work. A bad system prompt = bad answers, no matter how good the data is.
- Minimalistic design doesn‚Äôt mean boring. With the right focus (projects + chat), the site feels alive.

---

## What‚Äôs next
- Adding more **case studies** to my notes (so the AI can explain them directly).
- Iterating on the **chat UX** (live typing effect, better UI).
- Using the site as my **public lab notebook** ‚Äî building in public, but also training my AI model of me.
