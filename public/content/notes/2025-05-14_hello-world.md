This is the very first post on my website. I kept it simple on purposeâ€”no fluff, no filler, just a starting point.  
Think of it as a public notebook: sometimes raw, sometimes polished, but always *real*.  

In this post, Iâ€™ll explain:  
- Why I decided to start writing here  
- What kind of content you can expect  
- How I see this blog helping me stay accountable

## Why even write?
- Writing keeps me accountable.  
- It forces me to clarify my thoughts.  
- And itâ€™s a way to share what Iâ€™m working on with builders, founders, and anyone curious.  

---

## What to expect
- Posts about **projects** (technical details, design decisions, tradeoffs).  
- Notes on **tools, AI, automation** I experiment with.  
- My perspective on **bridging code with business strategy**.  

Thatâ€™s it in short.
