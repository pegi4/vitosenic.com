Recently, I needed to create a presentation about **Docker**.  
Instead of PowerPoint or Google Slides, I wanted something more developer-friendly, minimal, and web-native.  
Thatâ€™s when I found [**Reveal.js**](https://revealjs.com/) â€” an open-source HTML presentation framework.  

In this post, Iâ€™ll cover:  
- Why I picked Reveal.js instead of traditional slides  
- How I structured and customized the deck  
- How I hosted it live on GitHub Pages

## Why Reveal.js?
Reveal.js fit perfectly for a technical talk about Docker:  
- Presentations written in **Markdown or HTML**  
- Felt more like **coding a talk** than dragging slides  
- Built-in support for themes, syntax highlighting, and responsive design  
- Deployable anywhere (itâ€™s just static files)  

This approach was clean, minimal, and easy to share.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages
After finishing the slides, I wanted them online with no friction. The fastest solution: **GitHub Pages**.  

Steps I followed:  
- Pushed the Reveal.js project into a GitHub repo â†’ [View Repo](https://github.com/pegi4/docker-presentation)  
- Enabled GitHub Pages in the repo settings  
- The presentation went live instantly
