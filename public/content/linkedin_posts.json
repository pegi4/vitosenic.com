    "text": "The biggest poison in the Slovenian mindset is the belief that the \"State\" will provide. It’s a hangover from the past—a safety net that has made us mentally soft.\n\nWe look at the US and ask why they dominate. It’s simple: Their DNA is built on risk. Our DNA is built on safety. We have stayed in the same spot for a thousand years, waiting for handouts, while they crossed oceans to build something from nothing.\n\nWe need to stop acting like victims and start acting like Spartans.\n\nWe are a small nation. We cannot win on volume (like China). We cannot win on mass production. We must win on Elite Quality.\n\nLook at our athletes. They are the proof. A nation of 2 million people dominating the world stage. Why? Because in sports, you can’t fake it. You either perform, or you lose.\n\nWe need to transfer that \"Spartan\" DNA into business and technology.\n\nThe Goal: The Taiwan Strategy. We don’t need to be big.We need to be indispensable. We need to identify a niche, dominate it completely, and make the world dependent on us. That is true security. That is true power.\n\nStop waiting for the government to give you \"free AI\" or better policies. The State is just a reflection of the people. If you want a better State, become a better operator.\n\nLife is not about comfort. Comfort is stagnation. Life is about the glory of overcoming the impossible.\n\nDream bigger. Risk more.",

    "text": "Following my last post, I want to share what we actually built at the Hack the Future hackathon.\n\n​We competed in the AI & Insurtech challenge, tackling a problem we believe is universal.\n\nCompanies are struggling to make internal AI assistants (like Copilot) work.\n\n​The Problem:\nMany companies try to dump their entire knowledge base (all documents, all policies) into a single, massive LLM.\n\nThe result? Constant halucinations, \"context bleeding\" (e.g., a car insurance query getting answers from a life insurance policy), and zero traceability. \n\nThis approach fails.\n​\nOur Solution:\nWe didn't build a single \"all-knowing\" bot. We built an AI Agentic System based on a hierarchy of specialists.\n\n• ​Orchestrator Agent: The \"manager\" that first analyzes a user's query.\n\n• ​Specialist Agents: The Orchestrator then routes the query to a specialist (e.g., \"Auto Insurance Agent,\" \"Internal Process Agent\").\n\n• ​Specialized Knowledge: Critically, each agent has its own, isolated vector database. The auto agent cannot see the life insurance docs. This is the key to eliminating hallucinations.\n\n• ​Supervisor Agent: A final \"compliance\" agent that validates the answer before it's shown to the user.\n\n​\"But isn't a multi-agent system expensive and slow?\"\n\n​This is the most exciting part. It's not. This architecture is more efficient by using smaller, powerful open-source models. \n\nSpecialist agents built on models like DeepSeek-R1 or the new Kimi K2 (K2) are designed for this.\n\nThey can outperform giant, proprietary models on narrow tasks—delivering faster, cheaper, and more accurate results.\n\n​We believe this—a system of specialists, not a \"one-model-to-rule-them-all\" approach—is the real key to unlocking reliable enterprise AI.",

They spark that “aha” moment, they make you rethink ambition, risk, and what it takes to build.\n\n👉 Which one’s your favorite?\n Or what should I add to this list?",

Agents talking to agents.\n\nThat’s A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol https://lnkd.in/dNhNv82E) — an open spec (Google + 50+ partners) for interoperability. Not another wrapper. A common language so your sourcing agent briefs your CRM agent, which syncs with your scheduling agent, while compliance oversees it all.\n\nWhat A2A standardizes:\n👉 Agent Cards → agents advertise skills, auth, endpoints.\n👉 Tasks → Artifacts → workflows with state + outputs, not one-shots.\n👉 Collaboration Messages → context exchange, not duct-taped webhooks.\n👉 UX Negotiation → text, forms, files, audio, video.\n👉 Enterprise rails → HTTP, JSON-RPC, SSE.\n👉 Opaque by design → no secret-sauce leaks.\n\nHow it fits with MCP:\nMCP = connect agents to tools/resources (inside).\nA2A = connect agents to each other (outside).\n\nWinners won’t build “super agents.” They’ll orchestrate specialists via A2A — measurable, swappable, secure.\n\nSo… are you still shipping solo agents, or designing for multi-agent markets?\nDrop your first A2A use-case.

That’s only the surface. ⚡\n\nWhen I first looked into MCP, I went straight to the official docs (https://lnkd.in/dKwnKx9G). And that’s where it hit me. 💡\n\nMCP isn’t just about plugging APIs into your LLM.\nIt’s a protocol with layers:\n  - Resources → structured context injection\n  - Prompts → reusable prompt libraries, standard across clients\n  - Tools → yes, the obvious one, but only part of the puzzle\n  - Discovery → how agents actually find what they can use\n  - Sampling → steering how responses get generated\n  - Roots → defining what’s possible in the environment\n  - Elicitation → shaping how agents extract data from humans\n\nMost current clients only bother with Tools. That’s why people think MCP = tool calling.\n\nBut the real power? When all these components come together — a shared language for how AI agents access, use, and expand their world.\n\nThis is bigger than “LLM wrappers.”\nIt’s an operating system for agents. 🖥️ 🤖\n\nQuestion is:\nDo you see MCP evolving into the TCP/IP of the AI era — invisible but everywhere?\nOr will it stay a niche toy for the builders paying attention right now?\nI know where I’m placing my bet.

    "text": "The old e-commerce playbook is about to get torched.\n\nFor 20 years, merchants obsessed over funnels, landing pages, and checkout hacks. 🚀 Useless once AI agents start buying, not just recommending.\n\nThat’s what the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) does (https://lnkd.in/dgYHZnHE) — an open-source spec (Apache 2.0) backed by OpenAI + Stripe.\n\n ✅ ChatGPT can alrevady check out with merchants inside chat.\n ✅ Shopify + Etsy stores can apply with no extra integration.\n ✅ Works with digital goods, physical, subscriptions, async orders.\n\n👉 Merchant sign-up + details are live here: https://lnkd.in/dc_rdR6g\n\nGame-changer, right? Yes — but with caveats:\n ⚠️ It’s still a draft. Early adopters may need rewrites.\n ⚠️ US-only (for now).\n ⚠️ “Open” spec, but discovery + ranking will still be controlled.\n\nIf ACP sticks, your website won’t be the front door anymore.\nYour customer will just say “buy this” to an AI.\n\nSo: are you ready for commerce without a website? Or do you think this is just hype?\n\nComment below — I want to see who’s bold enough to bet on this.",

    "text": "Everyone screams “AI Agents” like it’s the next revolution.\nBut most people can’t even define what an agent actually is.\nHere’s the truth: an AI Agent isn’t just an LLM with prompts.\n\nIt’s a system. With:\n     - Environment → the world it operates in\n     - Sensors → how it perceives what’s happening\n     - Actuators → how it acts to change that world\n     - Memory + Knowledge → short-term and long-term intelligence\n\nThat’s when LLMs stop being “chatbots with nice answers”…\n…and start actually doing work.\n\nThere are different breeds of agents too:\n     - Reflex agents (just react)\n     - Goal-based agents (plan)\n     - Utility-based agents (optimize tradeoffs)\n     - Learning agents (improve over time)\n     - Multi-agent systems (work together or even compete)\n\nSo when does an agent make sense?\n👉 Open-ended problems (where you can’t hardcode every step)\n👉 Multi-step processes (complex workflows with tools + data)\n👉 Tasks that improve with feedback (real learning, not just parroting)\n\nHere’s the kicker: 95% of “agents” you see online aren’t agents at all. They’re just scripts chained together with marketing.\n\nWant to really understand the difference?\nThis free course breaks it down: AI Agents for Beginners\n\nI’m still connecting the dots myself — but every lesson makes the hype less mysterious, and more buildable.\nAre you willing to dig deeper, or stay on the surface?",

I wanted to know why this agentic hype works at all.\n\nSo I took this 👉 AI Agents for Beginners course by Microsoft (https://lnkd.in/de_ZfTEQ).\nAnd it’s gold:\n      - Clear breakdown of agentic AI architecture & design\n      - How tools, memory, protocols (MCP, A2A, NLWeb), and infra really connect\n      - Practical code examples across multiple languages & frameworks\n      - Theory first → then you spin it up locally and see it run\n\nNow, I get it — these courses are also a way for big cloud providers to push their infra, burn tokens, and lock you in.\n\nBut to be fair, this one felt surprisingly transparent. As an overview of the agentic hype, it actually delivers.\n\nThe wild part? The YouTube vids behind this course barely have 5k views. Almost nobody has touched it.\n\nMost people just want to drive the car. I’m the guy who wants to open the hood, see the gears turning, and know why it runs.\n\nSo here’s my challenge:\nWill you stay on the surface, stacking automations… or will you actually understand how agents really work?\n\nYour move. 🚀",

    "text": "Everyone talks about “AI agents.”\nBut under the hood? It’s just LLMs with a few tricks slapped on top.\n\nLast week I went back to the foundations — the real mechanics behind the hype:\n    - Prompting (the art that separates average outputs from genius ones)\n    - RAG (the hidden engine that makes AI actually useful)\n    - Cloud + infra (the layer everyone ignores, but where the scale happens)\n\nThis free course 👉 Microsoft Generative AI for Beginners (https://lnkd.in/d_vYjgU9) might be a year old, but it’s still absolutely relevant. Updated, practical, and it builds the fundamentals you need before diving into advanced systems like multi-agent architectures.\n\nBonus: Anthropic’s Skilljar courses (https://lnkd.in/ddHq7H9C) — crystal clear structure, perfect for nailing the basics.\n\nNow, I get it. For most people, you don’t need to know how a car engine works if all you want is to drive. Same with AI — tons of “gurus” are building agencies on Make, n8n, and automations. And honestly, I respect that speed and execution.\n\nBut I’m just a curious guy — like many of you here. I want to peek under the hood, see the gears turning, and understand why this stuff works.\n\nMy “aha”? Realizing these are just techniques to make LLMs — and other foundation models (image, video, etc.) — more useful than before. Nothing else. Before, it was just magic. Now, it makes sense.",

      "text": "💡 Slovenian vs English: how token-efficient are LLMs really?\n\nI was curious how much more (or less) efficient AI models are when working in Slovenian compared to English. So I tested it with OpenAI’s Tokenizer tool: https://lnkd.in/d9Zqm2XN\n\nHere’s what I found:\n🇸🇮 Slovenian: 304 tokens per 1000 characters\n🇬🇧 English: 181 tokens per 1000 characters\n    👉 That’s ~40% fewer tokens in English.\n\n📊 For comparison:\n    🇬🇧 English:\n       1 token ≈ ~4 characters\n       1 token ≈ ~¾ of a word\n       100 tokens ≈ ~75 words\n       1 paragraph ≈ ~100 tokens\n       1,500 words ≈ ~2,048 tokens\n\n   🇸🇮 Slovenian:\n      1 token ≈ ~3.3 characters\n      1 token ≈ ~½ of a word\n      100 tokens ≈ ~50 words\n      1 paragraph ≈ 120–150 tokens\n      1,500 words ≈ ~3,000 tokens\n\nAt first this looks like a big gap – more tokens mean:\n        - Higher cost → every request in Slovenian consumes more tokens.\n        - Less context space → fewer tokens left for documents / history.\n        - Potentially weaker answers → model runs “tighter” on context window.\n\nBut in practice, Slovenian still works fine for many local use cases (customer support, government services, education). English just gives you more “room” if you need large context or global knowledge.\n\n🔑 Takeaway: Token efficiency matters – but usability in your native language matters too.\n\n👉 What do you think – am I interpreting this right, or missing something? Would love to hear from others...",

    "text": "WhatsApp is built for control.\nTelegram is built for growth.\n\nWhen I hired an online fitness coach, all our chats ran through WhatsApp.\nHe had 100+ clients. His replies were slow. Naturally, I researched automation.\n\nWhat I found?\nWhatsApp Business API is fundamentally broken in Europe.\n\n❌ No coexistence: you can’t use the app + API together (thanks, GDPR).\n❌ Brutal pricing: after 24h, every message = Meta-approved template. Wrong category? You pay more.\n❌ Awful UX: to “go API,” a coach would literally lose WhatsApp on his phone.\n❌ No chat history access: you only get what’s coming in now. Old conversations? Manual export/import hell.\n\nThat’s not a business solution. That’s a nightmare.\n\nThen I looked at Telegram. Different universe:\n✅ Unlimited messaging, no restrictions.\n✅ Bots with full automation: anything you can code, you can run directly inside the business chat.\n✅ Business accounts with bot backend: hook a bot to your account and it replies as you. No “bot” label — clients think they’re talking directly to you.\n✅ Mini-apps: dashboards, portals, even CRMs — all inside Telegram.\n\nTelegram isn’t “just another chat app.”\nIt’s a platform. A business OS.\n\nWhatsApp = legacy.\nTelegram = future.\n\nIf you’re scaling communication, client support, or automation — ask yourself:\n👉 Are you still building on sand, or are you ready to switch before you’re forced?\n\n📖 Full breakdown here: https://lnkd.in/di_eWnM2",

We built him a solution:\n⚡ A digital twin that talked like him.\n⚡ Auto-generated diet & training plans.\n⚡ Coach only steps in for review — 80% of work gone.\n\nThe ROI? Crystal clear.\nMore time. More clients. More money.\n\nSo we pitched him. Live. In Ljubljana.\n\nHe liked the idea.\nBut then came the price tag.\nHe couldn’t pay. Not because it wasn’t valuable — but because he was a solo freelancer running on thin cash flow.\n\nThat’s when it hit me:\nWe didn’t fail on tech.\nWe failed on customer selection.\n\n👉 The right buyer pays 10x more for the same solution.\n👉 The wrong buyer can’t even start.\n\nOur first big miss. But the lesson will stick forever.\n\nFull story here: https://lnkd.in/drP7mbgK\n\nSo tell me — are you building for the problem… or for the buyer?",

    "text": "💡 Slovenian vs English: how token-efficient are LLMs really?\n\nI was curious how much more (or less) efficient AI models are when working in Slovenian compared to English. So I tested it with OpenAI’s Tokenizer tool: https://lnkd.in/d9Zqm2XN\n\nHere’s what I found:\n🇸🇮 Slovenian: 304 tokens per 1000 characters\n🇬🇧 English: 181 tokens per 1000 characters\n    👉 That’s ~40% fewer tokens in English.\n\n📊 For comparison:\n    🇬🇧 English:\n       1 token ≈ ~4 characters\n       1 token ≈ ~¾ of a word\n       100 tokens ≈ ~75 words\n       1 paragraph ≈ ~100 tokens\n       1,500 words ≈ ~2,048 tokens\n\n   🇸🇮 Slovenian:\n      1 token ≈ ~3.3 characters\n      1 token ≈ ~½ of a word\n      100 tokens ≈ ~50 words\n      1 paragraph ≈ 120–150 tokens\n      1,500 words ≈ ~3,000 tokens\n\nAt first this looks like a big gap – more tokens mean:\n        - Higher cost → every request in Slovenian consumes more tokens.\n        - Less context space → fewer tokens left for documents / history.\n        - Potentially weaker answers → model runs “tighter” on context window.\n\nBut in practice, Slovenian still works fine for many local use cases (customer support, government services, education). English just gives you more “room” if you need large context or global knowledge.\n\n🔑 Takeaway: Token efficiency matters – but usability in your native language matters too.\n\n👉 What do you think – am I interpreting this right, or missing something? Would love to hear from others...",

    "text": "Programming with AI is insanely fun. Process is:\n1. generate code\n2. read & understand code that was generated\n3. make small changes \"manually\" (still with great autocomplete)\n4. test & debug\n5. make big changes with new prompt\n6. go back to step 1\n\nPure vibe coding skips step 2 & 3. And I think we'll need human expertise & experience for steps 2, 3 (and 4) for quite a while.\n\nBut holy shit, I'm learning much faster, being way more productive, and having more fun.\n\nNot sure we're close to \"AGI/ASI\", but the software engineering world is definitely getting transformed very rapidly. It feels surreal to be experiencing it directly on a daily basis. Of course, there are both scary (jobs, security) & exciting (productivity, access) consequences to this transformation, as with all powerful technology.\n\nThis post was fully written by human in one-shot without spellcheck, it's 100% organic human writing 🤣",

    "text": "🚀 Out of my comfort zone — hitting publish.\n\nI just finished reading Digital Fluency — and it’s not the tech overviews that stuck with me, but the last chapter: “Your Digital Action Plan.” 📘\n\n💡 3 takeaways I’ll actually use:\nTools ≠ outcomes. Results come from org design, iteration cadence, and KPIs (buying an AI SaaS without process/KPIs = shelfware).\n\nEnterprise vs small teams. Big firms need governance & change management; small teams win on speed—borrow just enough playbook to scale without chaos.\n\nTech-fit, quick map: repetitive knowledge work → AI/copilots/agents 🤖 (e.g., first-pass email drafts) · many parties needing shared truth → blockchain ⛓️ (e.g., supplier ledger) · quantum ✨ → exciting, but early for most.\n\n🔍 What stood out: \nMany companies want to adopt AI or blockchain but quickly realise they lack the basic infrastructure — clean, centralised data, integrated systems, and scalable cloud setups.\n\nWithout this foundation, these technologies become little more than fancy buzzwords for sales pitches.\n\n💰 The real opportunity? Helping companies build that foundation — and then unlocking the real value of advanced tech.\n\nEven though the book was written in 2021 and the tech examples are dated, the decision-making frameworks are still timeless.\n\nFor the curious: 📘 Digital Fluency… (2021).
