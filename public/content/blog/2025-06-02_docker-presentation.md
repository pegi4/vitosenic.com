Recently, I needed to create a presentation about **Docker**.  
Instead of using PowerPoint or Google Slides, I wanted something more **developer-friendly, minimal, and web-native**.  

Thatâ€™s when I found [**Reveal.js**](https://revealjs.com/) â€” an open-source HTML presentation framework.

## Why Reveal.js?
- It lets you write presentations in **Markdown or HTML**.  
- It feels more like **coding a presentation** rather than dragging slides.  
- Built-in support for themes, syntax highlighting, and responsive design.  
- Deployable anywhere (itâ€™s just static files).  

This fit perfectly for a **technical talk about Docker** â€” clean, minimal, and easy to share.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages
After finishing the slides, I wanted them to be **publicly available online**.  
The fastest solution: **GitHub Pages**.  

- I pushed the Reveal.js project into a GitHub repo â†’ [View Repo](https://github.com/pegi4/docker-presentation)  
- Enabled GitHub Pages in repo settings.  
- Boom â†’ presentation was live.
